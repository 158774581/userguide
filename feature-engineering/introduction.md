#Introduction to Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is an important part of designing an effective machine
learning pipeline. It is best described as the process of transforming data
from its raw form to something more useful to the predictive model. This can
result in much better results on your task. 

The feature engineering tasks are grouped based on the feature types:

## Numeric Features

* [Quadratic Features](quadratic_features.md)
* [Feature Binning](feature_binner.md)
* [Numeric Imputer](numeric_imputer.md)
    
## Categorical Features

* [One Hot Encoder](one_hot_encoder.md)
* [Count Thresholder](count_thresholder.md)
* [Categorical Imputer](categorical_imputer.md)

# Image Features

* [Deep Feature Extractor](deep_feature_extractor.md)

# Text features

* [TF-IDF](tfidf.md)
* [Tokenizer](tokenizer.md)
* [BM25](bm25.md)
  
## Misc.

* [Hasher](feature_hasher.md)
* [Transformer Chain](transformer_chain.md)
* [Custom Transformer](custom_transformer.md)
