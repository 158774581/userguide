In this chapter, we demonstrate how to use GraphLab Create's distributed and
asynchronous execution framework to make it easy to take your prototypes to
production.

GraphLab Create provides a light-weight framework for executing jobs in 
distributed environments, specifying the execution environment (ex.  EC2, Hadoop),
with loose coupling, and management tools to support asynchronous execution.
